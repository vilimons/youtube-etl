# Extracting, Transformating and Loading datasets from YouTube

## Overview 

This project aims to securely manage, streamline, and perform analysis on the structured and semi-structured YouTube videos data based on the video categories and the trending metrics.

## Project Goals

Data Ingestion — Build a mechanism to ingest data from different sources
ETL System — We are getting data in raw format, transforming this data into the proper format
Data lake — We will be getting data from multiple sources so we need centralized repo to store them
Scalability — As the size of our data increases, we need to make sure our system scales with it
Cloud — We can’t process vast amounts of data on our local computer so we need to use the cloud, in this case, we will use AWS
